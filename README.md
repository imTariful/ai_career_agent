## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The User Journey: A Step-by-Step Walkthrough

The application is designed to feel like a guided session with a real career coach.

1.  **Build Your Profile**: The journey begins by creating a professional profile. The user inputs their work experience, existing skills, and long-term career goals.
2.  **Choose Your Path**: The user is presented with two powerful options:
    -   **Get General Recommendations**: Ideal for exploration. The AI analyzes the profile and suggests five fitting career paths.
    -   **Target a Dream Company**: For users with a specific goal. The AI generates a deep, strategic roadmap for landing a job at that company.
3.  **Analyze & Plan**:
    -   If on the "General" path, the user selects a job, analyzes their skill gaps, and generates a personalized learning path to bridge them.
    -   The "Dream Company" path directly provides a detailed skills and networking plan.
4.  **Learn & Grow**: The user follows their interactive learning path, marking off completed steps and getting AI feedback on their progress.
5.  **Prepare Application Materials**: Once confident in their skills, the user generates a tailored, ATS-friendly resume.
6.  **Find Opportunities**: The user can now search for live job openings for their target role.
7.  **Apply with Confidence**: For a promising job opening, the user generates a personalized cover letter.
8.  **Ace the Interview**: Finally, the user enters the Interview Prep module to practice with AI-generated questions and receive feedback, ensuring they are ready for the real thing.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Technical Details

This is a client-side, single-page application (SPA) built with React. It operates without a traditional backend server.

-   **State Management**: All application state is managed within the main `App.tsx` component using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`). The state is passed down to child components via props.
-   **Gemini API Integration**: All AI-powered logic is handled by making direct calls to the Google Gemini API from the browser. The `services/geminiService.ts` file acts as a dedicated layer for all API interactions, encapsulating the prompt engineering and response parsing logic.
-   **Local Persistence**: The user's entire session (profile, selected job, learning path, progress, generated resume) is saved to the browser's `localStorage`. This allows for a seamless experience, enabling users to return and continue their journey without losing their data.
-   **No Database**: The application is self-contained and does not require a database or backend infrastructure, simplifying deployment and maintenance.

## üß† AI Prompt Engineering

The quality of this application relies on sophisticated prompt engineering. We treat the Gemini model as a specialized expert in different contexts.

-   **Role-Based Prompting**: Each API call begins by assigning a role to the AI (e.g., "You are an expert AI Career Coach," "You are an expert ATS-friendly resume writer," "You are an expert AI hiring manager"). This sets the context and significantly improves the quality and tone of the response.
-   **Structured JSON Output**: For most features, we instruct Gemini to return a response in a specific JSON format. We provide the exact schema in the prompt and use the `responseMimeType: "application/json"` and `responseSchema` configurations. This allows for reliable, structured data that can be easily parsed and rendered in the UI, avoiding the fragility of parsing natural language.
-   **Two-Step Grounded Search**: For the "Find Live Jobs" feature, a two-step process ensures reliability.
    1.  **Search**: A prompt uses the `googleSearch` tool to find relevant information from the web.
    2.  **Extract**: The unstructured text from the search result is then fed into a second, simpler model (`gemini-2.5-flash`) with a strict JSON schema to reliably extract the job data. This separation of concerns is more robust than asking for grounded results and JSON in a single step.
-   **Chain-of-Thought & Contextual Data**: For features like the Cover Letter Generator, the prompt includes all relevant context‚Äîthe user's profile, the summary from their generated resume, and the details of the target job. This "chain of thought" allows the AI to make logical connections and produce a highly personalized and relevant output.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with Hooks) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for a modern, type-safe user interface.
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for rapid, utility-first styling.
-   **AI/LLM**: [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/docs)
    -   `gemini-2.5-pro`: Used for complex reasoning, planning, and generation tasks (e.g., creating the learning path, generating a resume, dream company roadmap).
    -   `gemini-2.5-flash`: Used for faster, less complex tasks (e.g., skill gap analysis, extracting JSON from text).
-   **Dependencies**: All dependencies are loaded via an `importmap` from a CDN, ensuring a lightweight and portable setup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Running the Application

This application is designed to run in a web-based development environment that provides the necessary files and an environment variable for the API key.

### API Key Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. The key **must** be provided as an environment variable named `API_KEY`. The application code (`services/geminiService.ts`) reads this key directly from `process.env.API_KEY`.
